## About

I built this template with all the tools I found useful to develop my own personal projects, so it can be a bit biased. If you find something that you think is not relevant or could be improved, please open an issue or a pull request to fix it.

## Features

**Vue.js + TypeScript**

- Because I love strongly typed languages (I'm a bit of a java developer at heart)

**Linting**

- Don't bother with linting ever again. Let Prettier handle it for you. Pre-commit hook included to lint your staged files.

**Testing Setup**

- Unit tests with Jest and Vue Test Utils
- E2e tests with Cypress (runs in the CI)

**UI**

- Multiple color themes
- Leverage the power of Tailwind CSS to build beautiful interfaces. You will find a Tailwind config file that you can customize to build your own theme.
- You can also use conventional scss style in the components.
- FontAwesome icons ready to use.

**SEO**

- Populate each page header metadata with name, description, image, etc.

**Accessibility**

- i18n preconfigured with two locales (English and French)

**PWA**

- Users can install the application on their device and run it offline

**Deployment**

- Example of CI with Travis-CI
- Ready to deploy on Netlify using git integration

```
